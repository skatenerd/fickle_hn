how fickle is hackernews?
when is it fickle?

what interesting things can i find?


to set up, you should probably do the following:
get easy_install
easy_install virtualenv
set up virtualenv
move contents of "fickle_hn/src" to your "/src"
activate easy_install 
easy_install beautifulsoup and pygresql

also, set up a postgres database HNDB with table hnposts.
a script for adding relevant columns is forthcoming

also, you might set up the relevant crontab
